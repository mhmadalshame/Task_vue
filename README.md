# Task Management Application

## Overview

This is a single-page application (SPA) for managing tasks, developed using Vue.js. The application allows users to view, create, update, and delete tasks seamlessly. It utilizes Vuex for state management and is designed with a clean and intuitive user interface.

## Features

- View a list of all tasks with details (title, description, status, created date).
- Create new tasks via a user-friendly form.
- Edit existing tasks using inline editing or modals.
- Delete tasks with a confirmation mechanism.
- Responsive design for mobile devices.
- Form validation to ensure required fields are filled correctly.
